## About Me
Hello, my name is Chance Patmore and I have a Bachelor's of Science in Information Communication Technology from the Unversity of Kentucky. As of right now, I am enrolled within the Master's program there and will be obtaining my MS in ICT in May of 2023. My background work specializes in coding in several languages such as python, C++, SQL, and PHP. I additionally have skills in website development where I use Github and a Netlify server link to deploy websites such as this for testing purposes as well as my own sites.
