Learning how to use Netlify and GitHub is something that I have always wanted to do.
A key concept in content management is to always update version numbers to reflect your current one.
Netlify and github are both very useful but seem to be used for different things.
Using both of them allowed me to create my Hugo site very quickly.
Now I see that using them in conjuction with each other allows for people to manage websites in a more productive manner. I have found useful videos for both netlify and github for more advanced features that we may use later in the course.
