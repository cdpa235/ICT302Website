I can identify and define key concepts in web content management.
I main concept is cleanliness or style. Making sure everything functions is nice but making
sure everything also looks nice will make your website look more professional and easier to manage.

I can describe and compare content management systems.
Github as a content management system is how I work best. I love computers and everything being a "file"
really helps me understand what I am doing.

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. 
Being able to use html in our discussions allows me to brush up on my prior skills. In the future. I plan to continue use it as much as possible.

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
Before this class I used w3Schools frequently for html and will continue to do so.
