## Key Concepts
My overall most important concept continues to be to not be afraid to drop a CMS. I much prefer WordPress and only use Hugo now for the required assignments. I will use WordPress 
for the forseeable future.

## Describing content management systems
WordPress uses a GUI or graphical user interface that allows for a user to easily create a site. While you still need to know how to write html, you can setup a basic site 
without the need for much coding through the tools available within the side toolbar. WordPress utilizing a GUI sets it up more similarly to a software which is a friendlier environment.

## Managing Content
My group for the Wordpress site is continuing to utilize Microsoft Teams in order to communicate
as well as the utilization fo the "kanban" scheduling for our tasks.

## Identify and Employ Technologies
The two technologies that we have used in the course frequently are Github and Netlify.
I have been able to adequately use the two in conjunction with each other in order to create a basic site for the CMS class.

## I can find and use self learning
W3schools continues to be my go to learning material for anything css, html, and php.
