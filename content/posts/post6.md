## Key Concepts
To me, style and organization are the most important concepts when managing a CMS. Having proper style whenever creating a page makes a page look better than it would otherwise. 
Additionally, organizing your content allows you to go back later and make modifications swiftly because you will know where it was previously.

## Describing content management systems
Github as a content management system uses a similar system setup to a computer.
Everything is stored as a "file" and within those files is the code. It is very convenient
and has allowed me to really learn how to maintain a site. WordPress on the other hand, is setup to resemble more of a graphical interface.

## Managing Content
My group for the Wordpress site has continued to utilize Microsoft Teams in order to communicate
as well as the utilization fo the "kanban" scheduling for our tasks.

## Identify and Employ Technologies
The two technologies that we have used in the course frequently are Github and Netlify.
Using the two I have been able to learn how to adequately deploy a site and make basic changes
through weekly posts and other design methods.

## I can find and use self learning
Continuing to utilize w3schools will allow me to keep up to date with my knowledge and what 
I am doing within the class.
