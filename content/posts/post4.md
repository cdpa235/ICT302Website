I can identify and define key concepts in web content management.
This is the same as last time. The concept that I keep referring back to is style. Keeping the code clean and formatted well makes it easier to read not only for yourself but any others who read your code.

I can describe and compare content management systems.
Github will continue to be how I work the best because it is the one management system we have truly used in the class.

I can manage content using established workflows.
The workflow I use is creating a draft on github and constantly letting netlify update my site in order to check for discrepancies and mistakes in my code. Also, now I will begin to 
Microsoft teams to keep in touch with my team and plan our schedules through a "kanban".

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. 
GitHub and Netlify are two technologies that I can identify and employ for content management.

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
I will continue to use w3schools as it is a reliable and convenient online source for learning new html and brushing up on what I already know.
