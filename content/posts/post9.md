## Key Concepts
My overall most important concept is do not be afraid to drop a CMS. Whenever we were first learning Hugo and Github it was interesting but was designed in a way that is not as 
appealing to me as something with a graphical interface. After learning WordPress, it made me realize that I can use it as opposed to Hugo for anything I want that does not require
Hugo.

## Describing content management systems
WordPress uses a GUI or graphical user interface that allows for a user to easily create a site. While you still need to know how to write html, you can setup a basic blog post 
without the need for much coding through the tools available within the side toolbar.

## Managing Content
My group for the Wordpress site has continued to utilize Microsoft Teams in order to communicate
as well as the utilization fo the "kanban" scheduling for our tasks.

## Identify and Employ Technologies
The two technologies that we have used in the course frequently are Github and Netlify.
Using the two I have been able to learn how to adequately deploy a site and make basic changes
through weekly posts and other design methods. I can now say that I can utilize WordPress as well. It is simple and the hardest thing about it is using HTML in the posts.

## I can find and use self learning
Continuing to utilize w3schools will allow me to keep up to date with my knowledge and what 
I am doing within the class.
