## KCM Training

Over the course of my internship, projects and more became frequent. However, my focus eventually settled on Governance, Risk Management, & Compliance. Governance focuses on the procedures and workplace policies that are established to maintain proper work management and to hold those accountable for their positions. Risk management focuses on what risks or liabilities may exist for an organization and the ways in which these risks can be negated completely or minimized with different security measures, policies, data storage procedures, and more. Lastly, compliance focuses on the laws, regulations, and more set-in place by the country, state, or region that an organization operates in. The objective within compliance is to make sure that the organization is compliant with the law and to continuously update policies and more to meet the requirements of new and changing laws.
	For GRC, the application that I used daily was KCM. KCM is published by KnowBe4 and is a compliance management tool that utilizes a web-based database for organizations to create, monitor, and modify different controls (plans to maintain or establish compliance). Before utilizing this software, however, a process is used to determine the best course of action in who to involve and when.

This process map details a three-fold process for creating new controls within KCM. This process map was developed by me utilizing the information that I gained during my internship on the separate processes, meetings, and more that happened well before even entering the KCM software.
	Firstly, when deciding whether to implement new controls a question needs to be answered. Is there a need? If the need is there, then you need to determine what laws or requirements would introduce the need for action. From here you can look over the existing policies within your organization to decide whether it is best to draft something completely new or expand upon or revise existing policies to encapsulate the new requirements. At the same time, it is best to start determining what departments will need to be involved based on the task at hand. Is the issue a security related policy? Then the security operations department would need to be tasked with providing evidence and monitoring capabilities. Is it an ethics concern or worker rights? Then it would be best to involve human resources. Determining what the requirements are and how they affect the differing departments of an organization early in the process can greatly benefit workflow. It allows you and your team to organize and create a plan of attack for new GRC implementations rather than waiting until the last minute to email your team or determine who needs to be placed where.

Whenever opening KCM you will be greeted with the page shown above. This is the dashboard that details what tasks you have been assigned. Additionally, it shows a breakdown of your daily tasks in the form of the task monitor that details how many tasks you have due for the day, if they are past due or not, as well as the addition of the Task calendar that allows you to look forward. This allows you to check if you have any tasks due later. 
Within this same page, there exists a sidebar that allows you to navigate the different subsections of the website. (Image shown below).

By clicking controls within the sidebar (Arrow in image above), you will be presented with a new page that details the controls library. (Shown Below)

These controls usually coincide with existing frameworks such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The National Institute of Standards and Technology cybersecurity framework introduces main techniques and guidelines for measures to place into an organization to manage and minimize risks. 
By navigating the control library list and clicking on a control you will be redirected to the page in which the control you chose lives. (Shown below)

This image shows the control name, description, and notes. Additionally, by utilizing the update and clone buttons, you can either update the existing control to add more information or clone it and create a copy by using the clone button. By scrolling further down the page, you will be greeted with the recurring tasks section. Clicking on any of the existing tasks will take you to the page specific to that task (Shown Below). Reminder: Multiple tasks can exist within a control.

Within this page you can view the task name, and description that details what is being required within the task. Additionally, data such as when the task starts and ends, the user assigned to the task, as well as the approving manager and what control the task belongs to are present. Like the control, you can update the task, but instead of clone task, the clone button is replaced by a delete task button. 
       However, to make a task, you can do so by clicking the create task button from the controls page. Doing so will bring up a popup window within the page (Shown below).

From here, you can populate the information that is seen within the previous image on the task page showing who is assigned the task, their manager, as well as information about when the task is due and its description. The create task page can be useful for controls that are updated or need to be revised to meet new requirements or fit into the implementation of new services or technologies.
