## Key Concepts
My overall most important concept continues to be to not be afraid to drop a CMS. I much prefer WordPress whenever possible and will only use Hugo whenever it is a requirement.

## Describing content management systems
WordPress uses a GUI or graphical user interface that allows for a user to easily create a site. While you still need to know how to write html, you can setup a basic site 
without the need for much coding through the tools available within the side toolbar. WordPress utilizing a GUI sets it up more similarly to a software which is a friendlier environment.

## Managing Content
My group for the Wordpress site is continuing to utilize Microsoft Teams in order to communicate
as well as the utilization fo the "kanban" scheduling for our tasks.

## Identify and Employ Technologies
The two technologies that we have used in the course frequently are Github and Netlify.
Using the two I have been able to learn how to adequately deploy a site and make basic changes
through weekly posts and other design methods. I can now say that I can utilize WordPress as well. It is simple and the hardest thing about it is using HTML in the posts.
Learning how to adjust the theme for the site was easier than expected.

## I can find and use self learning
The only self learning source that I have used and will continue to use is w3schools.
