## Key Concepts
The concept that I will continue to refer back to is style. Being able to write code that is clean
and well kept will allow anyone who reads your code to understand how it fits in and where.
It will also allow for easy maintenance if you decide to change something later.

## Describing content management systems
Github as a content management system uses a similar system setup to a computer.
Everything is stored as a "file" and within those files is the code. It is very convenient
and has allowed me to really learn how to maintain a site.

## Managing Content
My group for the Wordpress site has continued to utilize Microsoft Teams in order to communicate
as well as the utilization fo the "kanban" scheduling for our tasks.

## Identify and Employ Technologies
The two technologies that we have used in the course frequently are Github and Netlify.
Using the two I have been able to learn how to adequately deploy a site and make basic changes
through weekly posts and other design methods.

## I can find and use self learning
Continuing to utilize w3schools will allow me to keep up to date with my knowledge and what 
I am doing within the class.
