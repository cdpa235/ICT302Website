## Key Concepts
Last week I stated that style and organization are the most important concepts to me. My overall most important concept is now organization. I have been writing code
for a couple years now and it has always been a habit of mine to be organized. It makes life tremendously easier when you are trying to locate something.

## Describing content management systems
Github as a content management system uses a similar system setup to a computer. By this I mean that a page of your site has a file directory just as something like
an image on your PC would. Everything is stored as a "file" and within those files is the code. It is very convenient
and has allowed me to really learn how to maintain a site. WordPress on the other hand, is setup to resemble more of a graphical interface.

## Managing Content
My group for the Wordpress site has continued to utilize Microsoft Teams in order to communicate
as well as the utilization fo the "kanban" scheduling for our tasks.

## Identify and Employ Technologies
The two technologies that we have used in the course frequently are Github and Netlify.
Using the two I have been able to learn how to adequately deploy a site and make basic changes
through weekly posts and other design methods. I can now say that I can utilize WordPress as well. I can do so by learning its interface and 
expanding upon the things I already know such as HTML.

## I can find and use self learning
Continuing to utilize w3schools will allow me to keep up to date with my knowledge and what 
I am doing within the class.
